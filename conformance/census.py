"""Take a census of a cartridge library you own, and check the rewrite on all of it.

A cartridge header is thirty two bytes in which the cartridge describes how it is
built: which layout it declares, which coprocessor is fitted, how much ROM and
save memory it carries. Those are facts about a physical object. They are not
authored, they carry none of the game, and a count of how many cartridges share a
combination is a measurement rather than a copy.

So this reads those bytes from every cartridge in a library and writes down the
distinct combinations it found. It records no title, because a title is the one
header field that is a name rather than a measurement, and the corpus it produces
contains nothing from which any part of any cartridge could be reconstructed.

It also asks the header reader the same question and counts the disagreements.
Two packages that both decide whether a file carries a header, and disagree about
it, are two answers where there should be one, and the count is the only way to
know before a user finds out.

While it is there, it does the harder thing too. For every cartridge it runs the
whole rewrite and checks four properties that must hold on every real image:

- the value written and its complement are complements of each other
- recomputing the checksum over the result gives back the value that was written
- nothing outside a header changed
- rewriting an already rewritten image changes nothing

Beside them it measures one thing that is not a property: whether the checksum
this package computes is the one the cartridge already carries. That is the only
check which asks the artefact rather than asking the code whether it agrees with
itself, and it is the one that would have caught a checksum rule that was wrong
the same way every time. It is reported rather than enforced, because a hack that
changed content without recomputing its checksum is not a defect here.

Those checks need the cartridges, so they run here rather than in the test suite,
and their result is a count in the corpus rather than a claim the suite can
verify on its own. What the suite verifies is the part that replays from the
corpus alone: given a size and the four declared bytes, the size exponent and the
rewrite verdict.

A cartridge whose header cannot be found is counted as refused rather than
guessed at. Prototypes and unfinished dumps often carry a blank one, and
inventing a header for them would put fiction into a corpus of facts.

Whether this package computes the checksum a cartridge already carries is a
statement about the cartridge as much as about the code. It holds on a retail
image and does not hold on a hack that changed content without recomputing, and
a library of several thousand contains a great many of those. Making it a
property would turn every hack into a failure and drown the handful of retail
cartridges that genuinely disagree.

It is still the most valuable thing the census measures, because it is the only
check that asks the artefact instead of asking the code whether it agrees with
itself. The four properties above are all internal, and a checksum rule wrong the
same way every time passed all four for as long as it existed.
