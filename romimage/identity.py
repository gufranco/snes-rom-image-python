"""What makes a file itself, and which of those values is allowed to decide.

A project that cannot ship a cartridge still has to tell the reader which one to
supply, and has to refuse the wrong one before reading a byte of it. That means
publishing enough identity for a person to confirm their copy, and checking it in
code before use. A digest printed in a readme that nothing checks is decoration.

Each value here has one job, and publishing a row of hexadecimal without saying
which one decides is cargo cult.

| Value  | Job                                                     | Decides |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| size   | reject the wrong file for one stat, before hashing      | no      |
| crc32  | cross-reference against community databases             | no      |
| md5    | interoperate with database entries that still key on it | no      |
| sha1   | the same, for the databases that moved on once          | no      |
| sha256 | accept or reject                                        | yes     |

CRC32 is a 32-bit error code, not an integrity claim, and both MD5 and SHA-1 are
collision-broken. They are published so a reader can look their copy up somewhere
that still indexes by them, never so that code can decide by them.

A digest describes bytes, so it only means something alongside the exact form
those bytes are in: stub stripped or present, parts joined or separate. `dump`
answers that question, and every measurement here assumes it was asked first.
