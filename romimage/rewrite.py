"""Changing what a cartridge says about itself, and keeping it consistent.

Removing a coprocessor from a cartridge is mostly a question of code. The last
step is not: the header still declares the chip, and a machine that reads a
declaration the board cannot honour does not behave like one reading the truth.
So the header has to be rewritten, and rewriting it is where the mistakes are,
because three things have to stay consistent at once.

**The header is mirrored.** A cartridge image usually holds several byte-for-byte
copies of its header, because the same bank appears at several addresses. Tools
tend to read the first one they find, and they do not all agree about which that
is. Updating one copy produces an image that works in the tool it was tested in
and not on the machine it was built for.

**The checksum covers the fields that hold it.** The sixteen-bit sum is taken over
the whole image, including the four bytes storing the checksum and its complement,
which cannot be known before the sum. The convention resolves the circularity:
those four bytes count as `FF FF 00 00` whatever they actually hold, which is
`0x01FE` per header. Zero them, add `0x01FE` once per mirror, and the result is
the value to write.

**The size byte is an exponent, not a size.** It is the base-two logarithm of the
image in kilobytes, rounded up. An image that grew past a power of two and kept
its old byte declares itself smaller than it is, and a machine that trusts the
declaration never reads the rest.

Everything here returns a new image. Nothing is written in place, because a
half-rewritten header is worse than an unrewritten one, and a failure partway
through should leave nothing behind.

Finding the header is not this module's job, and an earlier version of it tried
anyway. It kept its own list of plausible mapping bytes, and a real library
disagreed with that list on six hundred cartridges: Contra III declares `53`,
HAL's Hole in One Golf declares `46`, and neither is in any table anyone has
written down. `mapper` decides by scoring four independent signals against that
same library, so the anchor comes from there and the disagreement cannot exist.

What is left here is the definition of a mirror, and it is simpler than the rule
it replaces. A mirror exists because the same bank is visible at two addresses,
so the bytes are literally the same bytes: every copy of the header is
byte-identical to the first. Searching for all thirty two of them rather than for
the title needs no allowlist of mapping bytes, and cannot match a title that
happens to appear in the middle of something else.
