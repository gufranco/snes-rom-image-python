"""Telling a reader which file to supply, and why the one they supplied is wrong.

A project that needs a cartridge it cannot ship has one obligation to the person
who owns one: publish enough identity for them to confirm their copy is the right
one, and verify it in code before reading a byte. Both halves matter. A digest
printed in a readme that nothing checks is decoration, and a check that reports
only "digest mismatch" tells the reader nothing they can act on.

So a mismatch is a diagnosis rather than a rejection. A file can miss for reasons
that are entirely the reader's to fix and entirely invisible from a digest: a
copier stub still attached, a split set not joined, a dump already known to be
damaged, a different regional revision, or the right size with altered content.
Each of those has a different next step, and naming which one it is turns a dead
end into an instruction.

The manifest carries facts about physical objects: sizes, digests, and the form
those digests describe. It carries no content, and nothing here reads a byte
outside the file it was handed. That is the line this module is built along:
publish behaviour and identity, never the work itself.
