"""What arrives on disk, before any of it is a cartridge.

A dump is not a cartridge image. It is a cartridge image plus whatever the device
that read it decided to add, minus whatever it decided to split off, and the
first job of anything reading one is to get back to the bytes the console would
have seen.

Two devices account for nearly all of it. A copier writes 512 bytes in front of
the image describing what it just read, which shifts every offset in the file by
an amount that appears nowhere in the file. A backup unit splits the image across
numbered files, of which only the first carries that stub. Neither is part of the
cartridge, and a tool that forgets either reads the right bytes from the wrong
place and reports something plausible.

The stub is detected by length rather than by content, because its content is not
standardised. That same test decides where a header reader looks, so it is
imported from the package that reads headers rather than restated here: two
implementations of one decision is one more than a decision can have and still be
relied on.

The rest of this module is measurement rather than format. Deflate ratio per
block finds the regions of a cartridge that are already compressed, since data a
general-purpose compressor cannot shrink further is usually data something else
already shrank. Chunk indexing answers how much of one image survived into
another, which is what tells you whether a rebuild changed what it meant to.
