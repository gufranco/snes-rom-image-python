"""Everything this package raises, in one place.

One module so a caller can see the whole set at once, and so `except` has
somewhere to import from. It imports nothing from the rest of the package, which
is what keeps it from ever closing a cycle: everything here raises, so everything
here imports this, and an import running the other way would make the order
modules happen to load in decide whether the package works at all.

It imports nothing from `mapper` either, which this package consumes as a
submodule. That is a stronger statement than the rule asks for and it costs
nothing: a refusal this package makes is this package's, and inheriting one from
the member it depends on would make a caller's `except` depend on which of the
two raised.
